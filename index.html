		"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door- Only this and nothing more." Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
		And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    	Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore—</p></div>
